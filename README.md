# LAN Operators
This mod adds **/op** and **/deop** to single player worlds, which can be used if the world is Opened to LAN.

## Installation Instructions
Only the host is required to install this mod.

1. Go to the [FabricMC website](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and download the latest installer
2. Run the JAR, a window will pop up. Choose the correct version of Minecraft and loader (this mod currently requires
   Minecraft v1.18.2 and loader v0.13.3), and click on "Install".
3. A new game version and profile will be created in the launcher's menu, which you can now use to launch Fabric.
4. Go to [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) or [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and download Fabric API.
5. Place the Fabric API Jar and the LAN Operators Jar into your "mods" folder
6. Run the newly installed profile from step 3

## What's the point?
If you wanted to open a creative world to LAN but are afraid of random people on the LAN joining and griefing, you can use this to only give select people special permissions to use commands.
This mod is a feature included in one of my other mods, Ngrok LAN ([Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/ngrok-lan), [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ngrok-lan)), to open your Single Player worlds as Servers. If you have Ngrok LAN installed you do not need this mod.
